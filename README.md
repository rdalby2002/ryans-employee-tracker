## Description

In a coorporate setting, it can be a headache sifting through databases to find info on employees and their roles, and an even greater one adding roles, departments, and employees to an existing database. That's why I made this employee tracking inquirer app. With it, one can perform all the functions listed above with simple terminal prompts.

## Installation

To install, clone the repository from github to a directory of your choice. From there, run npm i to install the necessary packages, and either source the sql files found in db, or source your own, in which case you'd just replace the database name in index.js with your own database's name. From there, delete the port: 8889 line from server.js and replace the password portion with your own mysql password. 

## Usage

After following the installation instructions, use the terminal to cd into the ryans-employee-tracker directory and run npm start. After doing so, follow the command prompts to perform any desired function within the database.
